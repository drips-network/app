Octant, a community-driven platform for experiments in decentralized governance that reward participation, has committed a total of 23.2 ETH (approximately $42k) to fund its critical software dependencies with Drips.

[Octant](https://octant.build/) & [Drips](https://drips.network/) share a commitment to strengthening the open-source ecosystem, and we couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled to partner with the Octant team.

# Octant is Dripping üí∞ to 4 Critical Projects

Octant has emerged as a major player in public goods funding in the past year. Their approach to using decentralized governance empowers the community to get involved in decision making around funding.

In 2023, Octant has already completed two public goods funding rounds, distributing $1M in ETH in Epoch Zero in July 2023 and 258 ETH (around $464k) in October 2023 to a variety of projects, including Drips!

Funds from Octant‚Äôs Epoch Zero and Epoch One will be streamed to the four dependencies on their [Drip List](https://www.drips.network/app/drip-lists/30178668158349445547603108732480118476541651095408979232800331391215): Web3.py, Flask, Wagmi, and Nimbus.

[Web3.py](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.py) is a Python library that allows developers to interact with the Ethereum blockchain easily. [Flask](https://www.drips.network/external/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpallets%2Fflask) is a micro web framework for Python, popular for its simplicity and flexibility in developing web applications. [Wagmi](https://www.drips.network/external/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwagmi-dev%2Fwagmi) is a collection of React Hooks that make it easier to connect a frontend to the Ethereum blockchain, and [Nimbus](https://nimbus.team/) is an Ethereum 2.0 client optimized for resource-restricted devices, which plays a crucial role in the network's sustainability.

Our partnership with Octant is only beginning. We‚Äôre hoping to see more funding directed towards Octant‚Äôs Drip List in Epoch Two, [which begins soon](https://x.com/OctantApp/status/1723995707084841354?s=20)!

# Why Octant Used Dripsüíß

Drips makes dependency funding possible at scale, giving projects a way to support **all** their dependencies at once, permissionlessly and programmatically. With Drips, you can stream to any GitHub repository you want and the recipient can claim the funds, whenever they want.

As Eleftherios Diakomichalis, Co-Founder of Radicle & Drips describes: "Drips‚Äô features, such as **per-second streaming**, **flexibility in token choice** as well as its **flexible identity model** where funders can stream to any Git forge URL or Ethereum address, ensures **a streamlined and user-friendly experience** for both our DAO and the recipients of funding. Unlike other solutions, **Drips makes programmatic, recurring funding easy and efficient** for both individuals and groups, so it‚Äôs multiplayer by design."

By streaming with Drips, you can help ensure the sustainable development, stability, security and continuous improvement of the critical software we all depend on.

It allows for running various governance experiments in a real-life environment and rewards user participation with ETH and is funded by staking rewards earned by the Golem Foundation‚Äôs 100,000 ETH.
