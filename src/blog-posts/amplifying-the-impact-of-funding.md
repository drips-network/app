# Funding is not an endpoint, it's a beginning

When you receive funding, whether through a retroactive public goods funding (RPGF) round, a grant, or community donations, it’s easy to see it as an achievement. But what if that funding could be more than a one-time milestone? What if it could spark an ongoing cycle of sustainability that benefits not just your project, but the entire ecosystem?

This is where **Drips** comes in. Drips is not just a funding tool \- it’s an **amplification tool**. It enables you to take any funding you receive and multiply its impact throughout the network of projects you rely on. Instead of treating grants as endpoints, you can turn them into catalysts for continuous, ecosystem-wide support.

# Amplification made simple: No complex metrics required

The digital public goods and grants ecosystem is always filled with discussions about **impact:** how to measure it, how to prove it and how to optimize for it. While these conversations are important, at Drips we take a different approach. We believe that **proving impact doesn’t always have to involve complex formulas or metrics**. For many, impact is simple. Do I read their content and find it useful? Do I rely on their open source code for my project to run? This is real and tangible impact that each individual can assess without metrics. Indeed Drips is a self selecting mechanism where you can decide as an individual (or collectively) what impact looks like to you.

But what we are saying is that regardless of where your funding has come from, one of the most straightforward ways to ensure further and increased impact of that funding is to split it with the dependencies that make your work possible.

**The act of sharing your funding with the projects you depend on is itself a form of measurable, tangible impact.** Every split you make strengthens the ecosystem and supports the often unsung maintainers and contributors behind critical infrastructure.

# Amplification for any type of funding

Whether you’ve just received a grant through a RPGF round or you’re distributing funds from a round you’re running yourself, Drips makes it easy to **amplify the reach of those funds**:

## If you’re a grant recipient:

- **Create a Drip List:** Set up your project on Drips, identify your dependencies, and allocate a portion of your funding to support them directly.
- **Amplify voluntarily:** No one is forcing you to share your funding but by doing so, you strengthen the very infrastructure that enables your project to thrive.
- **Be a leader in your ecosystem:** By "spreading the love," you not only support others but also inspire your peers to think about funding as a shared responsibility.

## If you’re running a funding round:

- **Distribute funds directly through Drips:** Make it easier for recipients to amplify their impact by distributing funds on Drips.
- **Encourage amplification:** Incorporate the concept of dependency funding into your communication with recipients & encourage them to think about **who made their work possible** and how they can amplify the impact using Drips.
- **Boost ecosystem resilience:** Funding rounds that encourage dependency splits create healthier ecosystems where foundational tools and contributors aren’t left behind.

# Growing the dependency graph: Small actions, exponential impact

Every project relies on a network of dependencies \- libraries, frameworks, infrastructure tools \- all of which are often underfunded. By allocating even a small percentage of your funding to these dependencies, you contribute to a **growing, dynamic dependency graph**. Here’s how it works:

1. You allocate a percentage of your funding to your key dependencies\*\*
2. Those dependencies, receiving new support, allocate a portion of their incoming funds to their dependencies
3. The cycle repeats, creating a chain reaction of support that reaches deep into the ecosystem.

Over time, a single grant can ripple outward to support dozens, or even hundreds, of interconnected projects. This is **amplification in action** \- funding that not only sustains but **multiplies its impact**.

# Why amplification matters

In a world where funding is often scarce and ecosystems can be fragile, **amplifying the impact of every grant and donation is crucial**. Drips makes this not just possible but effortless. With automated splits and transparent fund flows, you can ensure that **your funding doesn’t stop at your wallet.**

So next time you receive funding, ask yourself:

- How far can this go?
- Who helped me get here, and how can I support them?
- What kind of ecosystem do I want to be part of?

Start amplifying today, and help create an open-source ecosystem that’s not just sustained but **thriving**.
