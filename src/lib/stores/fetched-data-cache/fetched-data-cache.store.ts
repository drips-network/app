/**
 * Create a local "fetched data cache" that can be used to prevent data from being re-fetched
 * on navigations to a page that has already previously been navigated to.
 *
 * **Important**: There is no magic for removing data from this store. If data of a page that uses
 * this cache should be re-fetched, ensure that `invalidate` functions from `./invalidate.ts` are
 * called with the appropriate keys.
 *
 * **Also important**: No runtime type checking is being done. You need to make sure that
 *    1. The key you pass to this function is unique
 *    2. The type you pass to this function is correct
 *
 * **Also important**: What this returns is only a wrapper around a global store. Even if this
 * wrapper is abandoned, the values it wrote persist in the global store.
 * @param key
 * @returns
