Have you ever wanted your community to vote on a public goods funding initiative like a [RetroPGF round](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c) or decide the winners of a hackathon? Until now, managing those initiatives has been a cumbersome, admin-heavy ordeal, involving lots of manual work and juggling different tools for voting, allocation, and distribution. In the best-case scenario, the user experience is clunky. In the worst case, the process can stall, or funds can get lost.

Enter [Collaborative Drip Lists](https://docs.drips.network/support-your-dependencies/collaborative-drip-lists/creating-a-collaborative-drip-list). With collaborative lists, your community can seamlessly run a RetroPGF-style funding round or vote on hackathon winners using an off-the-shelf solution with a polished user experience that handles the entire process end-to-end!

# How It Works: Simple, Flexible, and Customizable

Collaborative lists function just like regular Drip Lists, except instead of one person curating the list, the projects that get funded are chosen collaboratively through voting.

The process starts when the **publisher** creates a list. The list can be customized by the publisher depending on the needs of your project. Voting can be public or private, depending on the desired level of transparency. You can also pre-select the potential funding recipients to be voted on or you can ask the collaborators to nominate and add potential recipients themselves. Either way adding potential recipients to a collaborative list is super easy and can be done by adding Ethereum addresses, GitHub repositories or even other existing Drip Lists.

Adding **collaborators** to vote on the list is simple too, just add their Ethereum addresses or for larger groups there’s even a CSV upload option.

Once everything is set up, the publisher sets an end date for voting, reviews the setup, and kicks off the vote! Each collaborator gets one vote which they can split between multiple recipients; deciding on the percentage of funds they think each should receive.

After voting concludes, the publisher finalizes and publishes the list as a full, on-chain Drip List that can then be funded by anyone!

# Case Study: Scroll Level Up Hackathon

In August, [Scroll used Collaborative Drip Lists](https://www.drips.network/blog/posts/scroll-argentinia-hackathon) to power a community vote for the winners of their [“Level Up” Hackathon](https://x.com/Scroll_ES/status/1818404010447286774) in Argentina.

Over 2500 community members were whitelisted, empowering them to help determine the winners of the hackathon. Before Collaborative Drip Lists, managing votes in such a large hackathon would have required hours of manual coordination. Thanks to the streamlined process of collaborative lists, Scroll was able to collect the votes effortlessly and distribute more than $20,000 USDC to [the hackathon winners](https://www.drips.network/app/drip-lists/41971962915943119138973997144514496143454239023249281594792952267407) with complete transparency.

# What’s now possible with Collaborative Drip Lists?

The Level Up Hackathon is a great example of how collaborative lists can enable community voting in hackathons. But their potential goes far beyond that.

With their flexibility and scalability, collaborative lists can also power full-scale RetroPGF-style public goods funding rounds within your ecosystem! Simply create the list, invite your RPGF badge-holders as collaborators, and you’re ready to go. You’ll get all the impact of a RetroPGF round, but with an amazing UX and an integrated, end-to-end solution for both allocation and distribution.

While hackathons and RPGF rounds are obvious use cases, we believe that they’re just the beginning. Collaborative lists are versatile enough to support any community-driven initiative that involves decision-making or resource allocation. Whether you want to fund new projects, reward contributors, or run large-scale community votes, Collaborative Drip Lists give you the control and transparency you need to make it happen.

What else can collaborative lists do? That’s a question for you and your community! If you want to explore how Collaborative Drips Lists can work for you then get in touch.
