Drips and [Web3Privacy Now](https://web3privacy.info/) are teaming up to launch [Drips for Privacy](https://drips.network/privacyproof24), a campaign dedicated to supporting the winners of the [2024 Privacy Proof Awards](https://awards.web3privacy.info/).

Web3Privacy Now has curated the [Drips For Privacy list](https://drips.network/privacyproof24), featuring this yearâ€™s award-winning projects. This Drip List allows anyone to directly fund and support these privacy initiatives, ensuring they receive the resources needed to continue their vital work.

## Why privacy matters
