  The Drips Network has been developed as part of a community effort with the support of the Better
  Internet Foundation. This website is maintained on a voluntary basis by the Public Goods
  Association (the &ldquo;Association&rdquo;), whose purpose is to build digital coordination
  infrastructure that enables the development of public goods. Neither the Better Internet
  Foundation nor the Public Goods Association own, manage, or control or act as an administrator or
  operator of the Drips Network. The Drips Network presently operates in a fully decentralized and
  autonomous manner and is fully integrated with the Ethereum protocol. Neither the Association nor
  the Foundation is involved in, or in any way responsible for the ongoing operation, maintenance,
  further development, running, or functioning of the Drips Network and/or any of the interactions,
  collaborations or contractual relationships between Users on the Drips Network. Being a
  decentralized network, any potential new and/or upgraded versions of the Drips Network can only be
  released through a community governance decision which neither the Better Internet Foundation or
  the Public Goods Association control.
</p>

<p>
  The Association has voluntarily posted this Disclaimer for the benefit of the community of users
  of the Drips Network [and for educational purposes only]. By accessing the Drips Network, You
  acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances shall the Association be liable to You for any
  losses or damages (including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages) arising
  out of your use, or your inability to use the Drips Network or the Software (as defined
  below).&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  This Disclaimer may be updated and modified from time to time. The Disclaimer as so updated and
  modified are deemed effective as of the date they are published on drips.network/disclaimer. It is
  the User&rsquo;s responsibility to periodically check for the most recent version of the
  Disclaimer.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This Disclaimer governs access to and use of the Drips Network. The Drips Network enables Users to
  stream and split tokens via a fully decentralized, autonomous, and non-custodial and gas-optimized
  protocol.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
  The Drips Network is a fully decentralized and autonomous ecosystem integrated with the Ethereum
  protocol. There is no single third party solely involved in or in any way responsible for the
  operation, running or functioning of the Drips Network and/or any of the interactions,
  collaborations or (contractual) relationships among Users on the Drips Network.
</p>

<p>
  The underlying software protocols of the Drips Network (the &ldquo;Software&rdquo;) have been
  developed and published under the GPLv3, Apache 2.0, and MIT licenses, which forms an integral
  part of this Disclaimer. The full license protocol of Drips Network can be viewed in the Drips
  codebases stored within https://github.com/drips-network.
</p>

<p>
  As the Drips Network (and in particular, the Software) is of experimental nature, You acknowledge
  that the Drips Network is likely to contain bugs, defects, or errors (including any bug, defect,
  or error relating to or resulting from the display, manipulation, processing, storage,
  transmission, or use of data) that may materially and adversely affects the use, functionality, or
  performance of the Drips Network (and/or the Software) or any product or system containing or used
  in conjunction with the Drips Network (and/or the Software).
</p>

<p>
  The Drips Protocol is a decentralized, autonomous set of smart contracts that enables Users to
  stream any ERC-20 token to any other User within the Drips Network. Streaming and/or sending
  ERC-20 token via the Drips Protocol requires a gas fee paid in ETH.
</p>

<p>
  THE DRIPS NETWORK AND/OR THE SOFTWARE ARE HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND ANY REAL ETH, DAI, RAD, OR OTHER
  ERC-20 TOKEN SENT TO POTENTIALLY INSECURE SOFTWARE THAT REMAINS UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE AT RISK OF
  BEING LOST INDEFINITELY, WITHOUT ANY KIND OF CONSIDERATION.
