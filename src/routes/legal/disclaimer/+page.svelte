  This is a disclaimer for the Radicle Network (the “Disclaimer”).Please read it carefully. The
  Radicle Network consists of the Radicle Technology Stack (including in particular, the Drips
  Protocol, the Radicle-Link P2P Protocol and the Radicle Client Interface) as well as any other
  Radicle technology, services and/or Content (as defined below).
</p>
<p>
  BY ACCESSING THE RADICLE NETWORK, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE RADICLE NETWORK
  IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. The Radicle Network is available for use to the public on an “as-is”

  This website is maintained on a voluntary basis by the Radicle Foundation (the “Foundation”). The
  Foundation is a Swiss foundation whose purpose is to support the development of resilient and
  humane software infrastructures.The Foundation is committed to supporting projects and people that
  develop non-extractive peer-to-peer technologies that promote internet freedom, including, among
  others, the Radicle Network. While the Foundation previously assisted in the development and
  deployment of the Radicle Network, which includes the Drips Protocol, the Foundation does not own,
  manage, or control or act as an administrator of the Radicle Network. The Radicle Network
  presently operates in a fully decentralized and autonomous manner, and the Drips Protocol offers
  Users an opt-in Ethereum protocol integration. The Foundation is neither involved in nor in any
  way responsible for the ongoing operation, running, or functioning of the Radicle Network and/or
  any of the interactions, collaborations or contractual relationships between Users on the Radicle
  Network.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This Disclaimer governs access to and use of the Radicle Network. The Radicle Network enables
  Users to manage software projects and to host, develop, and review software code in a
  collaborative manner.
</p>
<p>
  The Radicle Network is a fully decentralized and autonomous ecosystem with an opt-in Ethereum
  protocol integration, offered by the Drips Protocol. There is no single third party solely
  involved in or in any way responsible for the operation, running or functioning of the Radicle
  Network and/or any of the interactions, collaborations or (contractual) relationships among Users
  on the Radicle Network.
</p>
<p>
  The underlying software protocols of the Radicle Network (the “Software”) have been developed and
  published under the GPLv3 license, which forms an integral part of this Disclaimer. The full
  license strategy of Radicle Network can be viewed here:
  https://radicle.community/t/radicle-licensing-model/282.
</p>
<p>
  As the Radicle Network (and in particular, the Software) is of experimental nature, You
  acknowledge that the Radicle Network is likely to contain bugs, defects, or errors (including any
  bug, defect, or error relating to or resulting from the display, manipulation, processing,
  storage, transmission, or use of data) that may materially and adversely affects the use,
  functionality, or performance of the Radicle Network or any product or system containing or used
  in conjunction with the Radicle Network.
</p>
<p>
  Part of the Radicle Network’s feature set is a dedicated Ethereum-based transaction system (the
  Drips Protocol), which enables Users to transfer DAI / ETH and/or the Radicle Network’s native
  tokens (“Radicle Tokens”) via the Radicle Network to realize some core functionalities of the
  Radicle Network. Transfers of DAI / ETH via Radicle Network require ETH as gas.
</p>
<p>
  THE RADICLE NETWORK AND THE SOFTWARE ARE HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND ANY REAL ETH, DAI, OR RAD SENT TO
  POTENTIALLY INSECURE SOFTWARE THAT REMAINS UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE AT RISK OF BEING LOST
  INDEFINITELY, WITHOUT ANY KIND OF CONSIDERATION.
