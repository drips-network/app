The ENS Ecosystem Working Group will be streaming $50,000 USDC over the next six months to seven essential projects: Wagmi, ethers.js, graphql-request, OpenZeppelin contracts, noble hashes, scure-base, and dns-packet. This initiative highlights ENS DAO's commitment to retroactively reward the open-source projects that underpin its infrastructure.

The Drips network facilitates continuous and transparent funding, allowing organizations like ENS to ensure their software dependencies receive the necessary financial support. By utilizing Drips, ENS not only supports these direct software dependencies but also creates a broader impact as funds cascade down to the secondary dependencies that enable them.

Eleftherios Diakomichalis, founder of Drips, commented “ENS is leading the way in establishing a new cultural norm where on-chain organizations continuously fund the vital public infrastructure they depend on. No ifs and unnecessary complications—just simple and transparent support for the infrastructure that makes their work possible. This is what the future of public goods funding looks like.”
Slobo.eth, ENS ecosystem steward, added: “Drips is a great way to support open source developers who do important work for the ENS Ecosystem.” For more details on this initiative, visit the Drips network here.

Continuous Dependency Funding by ENS sets a precedent for other organizations looking to sustain and enhance their digital infrastructure through decentralized funding of public goods.
