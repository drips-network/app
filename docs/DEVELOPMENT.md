# ü§ì Development Instructions

## üëã Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## üå≥ Environment

There are a few environment variables required for the app to function. You can find an overview under `.env.template`. You ºll need access credentials for Pinata, Tenderly and a Gelato Relay API key for claiming projects. You ºll also need to set up `PUBLIC_NETWORK`, as described right below. Lastly, you'll need to sign up for a free Coinmarketcap API developer account and populate the `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` var. Lastly, set `PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY_URL` to the URL of the IPFS/Pinata gateway to use. You may use Drips' public IPFS gateway at `https://drips.mypinata.cloud`.

### üìà GraphQL API

The Drips App depends on the custom [Drips GraphQL API](https://github.com/drips-network/graphql-api). You need to set `GQL_URL` to a URL of the API's `graphql` endpoint, and `GQL_ACCESS_TOKEN` for the `Authorization: Bearer` token that should be used.

For most development tasks, you may use our Goerli deployment of the¬†API, hosted at [https://drips-api-goerli-s1.up.railway.app/](https://drips-api-goerli-s1.up.railway.app/). To use this API deployment, set `GQL_URL` to `https://drips-api-goerli-s1.up.railway.app/`, and `GQL_ACCESS_TOKEN` to `1234`. Ensure `PUBLIC_NETWORK` is set to `5`, so that both the app and API are talking to the Goerli testnet.

You can also use the local E2E env to easily spin up a fully-fledged deployment of the Drips GraphQL API, complete with event processing and a local, blank testnet to transact against. To do so, set `GQL_URL` to `http://localhost:8080/graphql`, `GQL_ACCESS_TOKEN` to `afdb8b7e-8fa7-4de9-bd95-b650b839e745`, and `PUBLIC_NETWORK` to `5`. Then, follow the instructions below under "üåê Run app locally with a local testnet".

### üîó Chain Config

To run the app, you ºll need to configure the `PUBLIC_NETWORK` environment variable. This should be the chainId of the chain you want to run the app for, and can currently be either 1, 5 or 11155111. The app will only allow connecting wallets that are set to this network, and all server-side requests will be made for this network's subgraph.

For your convenience, we ºve deployed production mirrors of the app set to allow testnet connections:

```sh
https://goerli.drips.network/ # PUBLIC_NETWORK set to 5
https://sepolia.drips.network/ # PUBLIC_NETWORK set to 11155111
```

## üë∑ Building GraphQL types

Before you run the dev server or build the app, you're going to need to build TypeScript types for GraphQL fragments and queries within the app. These auto-generated files, which are all situated in folders called `__generated__` adjacent to the `.ts` or `.svelte` files that define the GQL operation, are deliberately **not** tracked in Git to ensure the app's GQL types are always up-to-date with the GQL endpoint it is connected to.

To build GraphQL types, ensure you've configured the GraphQL endpoint as described above, and run `npm run build:graphql`. This command scans the entire repo for GQL definitions tagged with `gql`, and generates typings in adjacent `__generated__` folders.

Whenever you make a change to a GraphQL definition, like fragments or queries, ensure to run `npm run build:graphql` to make sure all definitions are valid and the typings are up-to-date.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Starting the local dev server

Assuming you've fully configured your local environment and built GraphQL types as described above, you can run a local development server as follows:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## üß™ Tests

Tests are setup with `vitest` as a runner, and `playwright` as the E2E test environment. Components can be unit-tested using `jsdom` (check `$lib/components/example/example.test.ts` for an example). Ensure unit tests follow the name format `*.unit.test.ts`, while E2E tests should be named like `*.e2e.test.ts`.

### Run unit tests

With all dependencies installed, simply run:

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### E2E tests

#### Running E2E tests

We're using `docker compose` to run a local test environment, including a `ganache` testnet with deployed Drips contracts (and a mock ERC-20), a local graph node with

To get started, make sure you have Docker installed & running, ensure the app's dependencies are installed via NPM, and execute from the root directory of the app:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

This will build a production version of the app, and execute all E2E test suites. Each test suite itself will run `docker compose up` to start the E2E test environment (ipfs node, anvil testnet w/ Drips contracts, and Graph Node w/ Drips subgraph). On first run, you ºll see `Pinging Graph Node‚Ä¶` being logged for an extended amount of time. On subsequent runs, this step will be a lot faster, because much of the E2E Docker environment is being cached.

**Important:** The local testnet is based on a static chain state which is copied into the testnet image from ./src/e2e-tests/docker/testnet/state. When a new version of contracts is released, this state needs to be updated. The subgraph is downloaded at image build time from the latest state of the `drips-subgraph` repo's `v2` branch.

#### Writing E2E tests

##### Starting the E2E test environment

To start the E2E environment (local testnet & graph node with deployed Drips contracts and subgraph), register the following Vitest callbacks on your test suites:

```ts
beforeAll(environment.start, 14400000);
afterAll(environment.stop);
```

This will start the Docker environment before the tests run, and shut it down at the end.

##### Configuring the app for testing

In order to connect the app to the local E2E network during an E2E test, add this `beforeAll` block in your test fixture:

```ts
import configureAppForTest from './helpers/configure-app-for-test';

// ‚Ä¶

beforeAll(async () => {
  server = await preview({ preview: { port: 3000 } });
  browser = await chromium.launch();
  page = await browser.newPage();

  // ‚Ä¶

  await configureAppForTest(page);
});
```

This utility sets a window variable `isPlaywrightTest` to `true`, causing the app to connect to the local testnet and subgraph.

When starting your E2E test like this, user `0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266` is automatically and immediately connected to the app, and has a balance of 100 TEST.

#### Interacting with the Mock ERC-20

As part of E2E environment setup, a mock ERC-20 token is deployed at `0xefbF81372aBC3723463746a89CEb42080563684C`, and automatically grants address `0x433220a86126eFe2b8C98a723E73eBAd2D0CbaDc` a balance of `100000000000000000000` wei. In order to be able to use this token within the app in your tests, you can append a "custom token" to localstorage, which will be picked up by `tokens.store` upon startup.

Simply run the following in a `page.addInitScript` block:

```js
localStorage.setItem(
  'custom-tokens',
  JSON.stringify([
    {
      source: 'custom',
      banned: false,
      info: {
        chainId: 5,
        address: '0xefbF81372aBC3723463746a89CEb42080563684C',
        name: 'Testcoin',
        decimals: 18,
        symbol: 'TEST',
      },
    },
  ]),
);
```

After doing this, the app will display the token within all token pickers. Alternatively, you can also run through adding the custom token via the UI within your test.

#### `PUBLIC_TEST_MODE` and `playwrightAddress`

Unfortunately, two major differences in app logic for E2E tests couldn ºt be avoided: Firstly, the app uses a mock wallet store that connects to the local testnet instead of the real one, and IPFS access is mocked using localstorage. The logic checks for an env variable `PUBLIC_TEST_MODE` being true. The mock wallet store also checks for `window.playwrightAddress`, and initializes itself to be connected to that address. In order to make use of these adjustments, call `page.addInitScript` and set the two variables.

## üò± Advanced

### üåê Run app locally with a local testnet

It's possible to connect the app running locally to the local E2E test environment described above. This allows simple and quick development locally, as all transactions will resolve instantly, and network requests are a lot faster. To do so, run `npm run dev:local-env:start-env` to up the local development environment, then run `dev:local-env:start-app` to start the dev server and connect it to the local services. Once done, run `npm run dev:local-env:stop-env` to stop the local development environment.
