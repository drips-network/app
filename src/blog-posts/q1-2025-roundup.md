Welcome back to the Drips quarterly update!

Q1 2025 was another period of significant growth and building. We expanded the reach of Drips to new networks, enhanced core platform functionality, and laid the groundwork for some innovative features coming soon. We're excited to share the latest developments, let's check out the highlights!

# üöÄ Drips Expands: Welcoming Optimism and Metis

Following our Filecoin launch last quarter, we continued our multichain journey by deploying Drips on two more exciting networks: Optimism and Metis!

**Optimism:** We're thrilled to launch on Optimism with [**"Drips for Privacy"**](https://optimism.drips.network/app/drip-lists/46441013481627019632859175771245733399752255312769848791334977723541), a collaborative campaign alongside [web3privacy](https://web3privacy.info/) now. This initiative allows anyone to easily support a curated collection of privacy-focused projects that were nominated for a [Privacy Proof award in 2024](https://awards.web3privacy.info/). To celebrate, we've also introduced a vibrant new "Optimistic Red" theme for the Drips app! Head over to Settings ‚Üí Primary Color in the app to try it out.

**Metis:** Our deployment on Metis comes as the chosen platform for distributing proceeds from the [Metis Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF)](https://metis.drips.network) program. We're honored to support their ecosystem's public goods and look forward to facilitating future funding rounds.

Expanding to new chains involves significant effort across our infrastructure. Users can now seamlessly switch between Ethereum, Filecoin, Optimism, and Metis using the network picker in the app.

Shout out to [Igor](https://github.com/codesandwich), [Giannis](https://github.com/jtourkos), [Morgan](https://github.com/mhgbrown) and everyone else involved in bringing Drips to more chains.

# üîç Find Anything Faster: Introducing Universal Search

Navigating Drips just got a whole lot easier! We've launched a powerful new search engine directly within the Drips app.

Now you can instantly search Projects, Drip Lists, addresses, and more on Drips. Simply click the search icon in the app header. This was a highly requested feature, and we believe it significantly improves the usability of the platform, especially as more projects and users join.

Big thanks to [Giannis](https://github.com/jtourkos) for bringing this essential feature to life!

# ‚öôÔ∏è Under the Hood: Infrastructure & DevEx Improvements

While shipping new user-facing features, we also invested heavily in our backend infrastructure and developer experience. We're excited to announce that anyone can now easily run the _entire_ Drips stack (protocol contracts, subgraph, GraphQL API, web app) locally using `docker-compose`, complete with a local testnet.

This makes it simpler than ever for community members to contribute, test changes, or build integrations. Check out the updated [`DEVELOPMENT.md` guide](https://github.com/drips-network/app/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) in the Drips app repository to get started.

# üëÄ Sneak Peek: What's Cooking for Q2? Ecosystems!

We're constantly thinking about the future of sustainable funding for open source and public goods. Right now, something big is cooking: **Ecosystems**.

Imagine Drip Lists, but supercharged. Ecosystems on Drips will represent vast networks of projects and their dependencies as an interconnected graph. This structure will enable funding flows to potentially tens of thousands of GitHub repositories simultaneously, mapping out and supporting entire software ecosystems.

The first major application for Ecosystems is already lined up: we're collaborating on **Deep Funding**, Vitalik Buterin's latest experiment exploring novel approaches to public goods funding.

We're incredibly excited about the potential of Ecosystems to scale dependency funding massively. Stay tuned for more details as we get closer to launch!

# What's next?

In Q2, alongside our work on Ecosystems, we'll continue refining the multichain experience, improving core features, and listening to your feedback.
