  The Drips protocol is a collection of public, open smart contracts deployed on EVM-based
  blockchains, equally accessible to every user and application. Because of this, there is no one
  single way of interacting with the Drips protocol. While the Drips App is one way of interacting
  with the Drips protocol, users can also access the full power and functionality of Drips contracts
  in any of the following alternative ways as well:
</p>
<p>
  The <a

    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer">Drips SDK</a
  > is a Javascript SDK that allows any application or user-created code to interact directly with the
  Drips smart contracts and utilize the full feature set of the protocol in whatever way they wish. Drips
  contracts can be freely integrated into any website, dapp or application at any time using the SDK.

  <a href="https://etherscan.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etherscan</a> is a block
  explorer and analytics platform for Ethereum. Other networks have similar block exploers, often
  also operated by Etherscan. The Drips contracts can be accessed using these block explorers at the
  addresses specified on the

  >. For example, the DripsHub smart contract on the Rinkeby testnet can be acessed

<p>
  <a href="https://eth.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ethBuild</a> is an educational
  sandbox for web3, including drag-and-drop programming and open source building blocks. With ethBuild,
  you can call a function on an Ethereum contract (for example, to create a Drip or Split configuration)
  by sending it a transaction with the function arguments in the data.

  open-source platform allows you to generate wallets, interact with (Drips) smart contracts, and more.

  The <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >web3.js Library</a

  contracts.

<p>
  The <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/v5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >ethers.js Library</a
  > is another Javascript library for interacting directly with Ethereum smart contracts, including the
  Drips smart contracts.
