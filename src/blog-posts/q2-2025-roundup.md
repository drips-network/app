# **Q2 2025 Roundup: RPGF on Drips and Berlin vibes**

From major feature announcements to real-world conversations, Q2 was all about continuing to build and showing up IRL.

Let‚Äôs dive into what went down in Q2 at Drips.

**üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª Announced: End-to-End RPGF rounds on Drips**

This quarter, we announced one of the biggest upgrades to the Drips protocol yet: **support for full retroactive public goods funding (RPGF) rounds, end-to-end**.

Anyone, from DAOs to foundations to ecosystem teams, will soon be able to run RPGF rounds directly on Drips. That includes:

- Nomination and curation of projects
- Round-based voting
- Automated payouts through Drips once rounds conclude

It‚Äôs all fully composable and built to be flexible, so funders can easily design the kinds of RPGF rounds that best suit their goals and run it all on one platform.

We‚Äôre almost finished building and this will launch very soon in Q3.

## **üìçLaunched: The Drips Guide to Berlin**

![Berlin basics on the Drips guide to Berlin](/assets/blog-images/drips-guide-to-berlin-basics.png)

To help visitors (and locals) make the most of Berlin Blockchain Week, we put together the **Drips Guide to Berlin** \- a curated microsite of the best events, venues, and spots to unwind.

The guide featured the team‚Äôs top picks for the week‚Äôs most relevant events plus how to get the most of the city outside of Blockchain Week.

Even though Blockchain Week is over, the site lives on\! If you‚Äôre ever in Berlin and in need of some excellent recommendations for drinks, coffee or clubbing you should start here: Berlin.drips.network

## **üó£Ô∏è IRL in Berlin: panels, meetups & conversations**

Beyond the guide, the Drips team was on the ground throughout Berlin Blockchain Week. We participated in a number of events across the city, sharing what we‚Äôve been building and joining conversations on the future of funding & sustainable ecosystems.

Whether it was speaking on panels, demoing new features, or just meeting fellow builders face to face, Berlin was a great reminder of why this work matters.

Pro-tip: check out Warren‚Äôs talk at Protocol Berg for a sneak peak at what else we‚Äôll be launching in Q3‚Ä¶

üé§ **Talks and events we joined:**

- Funding the Commons

Thanks to everyone who came out, asked great questions, and helped shape the conversation. If we missed each other in Berlin, trust there will be more chances soon.

## **‚è≠Ô∏è Looking ahead**

A lot of work in Q2 was building up for Q3 and we‚Äôve got a lot to share in the coming months:

- The full launch of RPGF capability on Drips
- Continued upgrades to the app and protocol
