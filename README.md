# Drips App

| 🏗️ This app is under active development, and currently available at [drips.network](https://drips.network/). |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Drips 💧 is a protocol (and app), built on Ethereum, that enables organizations and individuals to directly and publicly provide funding to the free and open source software projects they depend on the most.

Drips also includes gas-optimized and integrated primitives for streaming and splitting tokens, allowing users and web3 apps to stream and split funds by the second with continuous settlement for use cases like contributor payments, vesting and subscription memberships.

This app enables user-friendly, simple management of a Drip List for funding up to 200 open-source software projects at a time with a single continuous stream of any ERC-20 token. For project maintainers, it enables a user-friendly project claim flow. Additionally, users can set up and manage any number of arbitrary streams of any ERC-20 to any Ethereum address .

## 💦 Development

Find instructions for running the app & tests locally in the [Development Guide](/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
