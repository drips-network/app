It’s here\! Your solution for **end-to-end RetroPGF on Drips**. It’s never been easier to run impact-based funding rounds: publish a round, collect and review applications, run badgeholder voting, export results, and **pay winners directly to GitHub repositories** all in one place.

## **Kicking things off with Filecoin**

We’re thrilled to announce that **Filecoin** will be the first team to run a RetroPGF round on Drips. Their upcoming **FIL RetroPGF Round 3** is a landmark moment \- **585,000 FIL (over $1M)** \- will be distributed to the most impactful applicants, with a clear focus on credible processes, real users, and measurable, on-chain impact.

From early experiments to increasingly refined programs, Filecoin has shown how public goods funding drives real innovation. **FIL RetroPGF Round 3** raises the bar again with a bigger pool, sharper focus, and a clear commitment to rewarding demonstrable contributions across the ecosystem.

This collaboration fits our shared belief that **funding is a catalyst, not just an endpoint**. With Drips, payouts can amplify across the ecosystem: projects can forward a portion of their grant to their own dependencies, strengthening the foundational tools your work relies on.

## **What you get with RetroPGF on Drips**

This launch reflects what we’ve been building toward: a **comprehensive toolkit** that simplifies the complexities of RPGF rounds so you can focus on what truly matters \- **identifying and rewarding valuable contributions**.

- **Full round management**: Applications → review → voting → payouts in one place
- **Direct repo payouts**: distribute funds straight to **GitHub repositories**; no address collection needed
- **Customizable applications**: flexible forms with support for **private admin fields**
- **On-chain attestations**: applications and rewards attested on-chain for maximum transparency
- **Great UX**: clear, focused flows for applicants and badgeholders
- **Amplify the impact**: winners can immediately choose to forward a percentage to other projects they depend on, dependency funding built in

Altogether this streamlines round management and maximizes the positive impact of the rewards you distribute. What could be better?
