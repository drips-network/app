# Taking RetroPGF to the Next Level: A Seamless, End-to-End Solution

Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RPGF) is a powerful mechanism to reward impactful work and foster thriving ecosystems. At Drips, we believe the process of running RPGF rounds should be as efficient and impactful as the outcomes they aim to achieve. While Drips has supported basic voting via Collaborative Drip Lists, we've heard the need for a more comprehensive solution.

Today, we're thrilled to give you a first look at our **upcoming end-to-end functionality for running RetroPGF rounds, entirely on Drips.** This new suite of tools will empower organizers to manage every stage of their RPGF program seamlessly – from initial setup to final distribution, all while leveraging Drips' unique ability to amplify funding throughout the ecosystem.

# Your RPGF Round, Streamlined: Milestones Made Easy

We're building a comprehensive toolkit designed to simplify the complexities of RPGF rounds, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: identifying and rewarding valuable contributions. Here’s how Drips will support each key milestone:

## 1. Configuring and Publishing Your Round

First impressions matter. Drips will enable you to set up and launch your round with a **beautiful, shareable, and public round profile.** This profile acts as the central hub for your RPGF program, displaying all information and real-time updates.

- **Key Features:**
  - Showcase everything about your round in one place.
  - Real-time timeline displaying the current stage.
  - Rich round descriptions with Markdown support.
  - Collaborate with multiple admins to manage and adjust round settings.

## 2. Application Intake: Simplified and Secure

Attracting the right applicants is crucial. We're making the application process smooth for projects and highly customizable for round administrators.

- **Key Features:**
  - Fully customizable application forms, including private fields for admin use.
  - Projects can easily apply by selecting their existing Drips-claimed projects.
  - All applications are attested on-chain, ensuring transparency and security.

## 3. Application Review: Efficient and Transparent

Managing a high volume of applications can be daunting. Drips will provide intuitive tools for admins to review submissions efficiently.

  - Approved applications are automatically made public on the round profile, keeping the community informed.

## 4. Voting: Empowering Badgeholders

The heart of any RPGF round is the voting process. We're designing an **easy-to-use voting UI** tailored for RPGF Badgeholders to cast their ballots confidently and conveniently.

- **Key Features:**
  - Clear presentation of applications and their details.
  - Intuitive interface for allocating votes.
  - Designed for a smooth and accessible voting experience.

## 5. Results: Clear, Comprehensive Insights

Transparency in results is key to building trust. Once voting closes, admins will have full access to the data.

- **Key Features:**
  - View and download the full raw data of the vote as CSVs.
  - Access all individual ballots and overall vote totals per application.

## 6. Distribution: Direct, Hassle-Free, and Amplified

The final step is getting funds to the deserving projects. Drips makes this uniquely efficient and impactful.

- **Key Features:**
  - Seamlessly create Drip Lists based on voting results directly within the Drips app.
  - **Distribute funds directly to GitHub repositories** associated with the projects – no more manually collecting and verifying countless ETH addresses.
  - Projects claim their funds on Drips and can immediately choose to **forward a percentage to other projects they depend on**, amplifying the impact of your funding round throughout the ecosystem. This is the Drips difference!

# Amplify Your Impact: The Drips Ecosystem Advantage

This new end-to-end RPGF tooling is built on the core Drips philosophy: **funding is a catalyst, not just an endpoint.** By enabling distributions directly to projects on Drips, recipients can effortlessly share a portion of their funding with their own dependencies. This creates a virtuous cycle, ensuring that support flows deeper into the ecosystem, strengthening the often-unsung foundations that all projects rely on.
