Last month we announced Drips Wave, a new way for ecosystems to run contribution cycles using Drips’ infrastructure. We want to give you more details about what’s coming up: why we built Wave, what it enables for developers and maintainers, and what to expect from the first wave launching with the [Stellar Development Foundation](https://stellar.org/foundation) in January 2026.

## Why We Built Drips Wave

Across open-source projects and ecosystems there’s a consistent gap between available funding and the day-to-day work that maintainers need help with. Grants and longer programs play an important role, but they aren't necessarily designed to move quickly or focus on every day maintenance work and priorities. On the other side, new developers looking to get involved often lack a defined entry point.

**Drips Wave aims to address this gap by:**

- Creating short, structured contribution cycles.
- Focusing on a selected set of repositories and scoping work that ecosystems want to accelerate.
- Allowing contributors to participate with a clear understanding of expectations.
- Reducing operational overhead for maintainers.

It’s a predictable environment for doing what open-source contributors do best: **fix, merge, and now with the ability to earn.**

The model draws from Drips’ broader mission of making funding more accessible and more closely aligned with the actual workflows of open-source development.

## What Developers Can Expect

Waves are grounded in the idea that contribution should feel accessible, transparent, and worth the effort. When a cycle opens, contributors can browse scoped issues, sync their GitHub account, and begin immediately.

### Key Features for Contributors

- **Automation:** The platform handles contribution tracking, the review flow, and automated rewards.
- **Accessibility:** For newer developers, Waves offer understandable tasks and timely feedback to build a visible track record.
- **Global Reach:** We regularly see contributors from LATAM, Africa, and Southeast Asia use cycles like these to gain experience and earn meaningful income.

## What Waves Provide for Maintainers and Ecosystems

Waves give maintainers focused support aligned with their capacity and roadmap. Because scopes are defined ahead of each cycle, contributors arrive prepared and maintainers can guide work without administrative burden.

For ecosystems, Waves create a **repeatable way to convert funding into tangible progress**. Contribution flow becomes visible through a unified system, making it easier to understand:

1. Where attention is going.
2. Which areas need additional support.
3. How short-cycle funding performs in practice.

## January 2026: Stellar Wave 1

The first full Wave will begin in January with **Stellar Wave 1**. Ahead of the launch, you’ll be able to browse the participating repositories, scopes, and contribution guidelines.

For the first ever Drips Wave we’re working with the [Stellar Development Foundation](https://stellar.org/foundation). Stellar has demonstrated a clear commitment to creating practical, accessible pathways for developers at all levels. Their commitment to Waves reflects a broader effort to:

- Strengthen onboarding.
- Support maintainers.
- Invest in foundational work for the Soroban ecosystem.

## Looking Ahead

Waves are designed to complement, not replace, existing funding mechanisms. They provide rhythm, focus, and a reliable path into work that is often essential but difficult to prioritize.
