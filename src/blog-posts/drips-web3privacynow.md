Drips and [Web3Privacy Now](https://web3privacy.info/) have teamed up to launch [Drips for Privacy](https://drips.network/privacyproof24), a campaign dedicated to supporting the winners of the [2024 Privacy Proof Awards](https://awards.web3privacy.info/), celebration of contributions to the privacy ecosystem.

As part of this initiative, Web3Privacy Now has curated one of the first Awesome Drip Lists, featuring this yearâ€™s award-winning projects. This list allows anyone to directly fund and support these privacy initiatives, ensuring they receive the resources needed to continue their vital work.

## Why privacy matters

Privacy is the foundation of trust and decentralization. As the digital landscape evolves, supporting privacy-centric projects is more critical than ever. Drips for Privacy creates sustainable, transparent funding streams to help these recognized projects thrive and make a lasting impact.
