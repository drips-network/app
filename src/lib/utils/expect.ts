/**
 * Function `func` will be called roughly every `checkingEvery` milliseconds, up to roughly
 * `within` milliseconds total. Every time, its returned value is compared with `toMatchCondition`.
 * If it's a match, returns the return value of `func`. If after all tries are exceeded
 * the condition still doesn't match, a `FailedExpectation` is returned.
 * @param func The function to execute every `checkingEvery` for `within` millis total.
 * @param toMatchCondition The comparator function to run against `func`'s return value
 * on every try.
 * @param within How many milliseconds we should keep on trying for. Keep in mind that
 * if `func` is a slow-resolving promise, we may end up waiting for a bit longer than
 * this value.
 * @param checkingEvery How much time we should wait between each attempt.
 * @returns Return type of `func` matching `toMatchCondition`, or a `FailedExpectation`
 * if it never did.
