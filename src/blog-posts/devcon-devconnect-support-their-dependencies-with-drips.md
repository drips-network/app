# **Devcon & Devconnect Supporting their Dependencies with Drips**

The Devcon team & Drips share a commitment to strengthening the open-source ecosystem that powers the Ethereum Ecosystem, and we’re thrilled to work with them.

## **Funding in Action: $30,000 to OSS**

Beyond speakers, venues, and schedules, Devcon has a layer of open-source tools that enable planning, production, streaming and comms. For the team it’s simple: if Devcon benefits from these tools, the people who build and maintain them should benefit too.

Using Drips, a decentralised platform for funding open source projects, the Ethereum Foundation events team has allocated $30,000 support to the tools and libraries they depend on.

"Open-source software forms the backbone of our modern, digital world and is critical to the success and sustainability of the Ethereum ecosystem. With this initiative we want to support the open-source projects, and its maintainers that we're depending on for the success of Devcon."
— _Wesley, Devcon/nect team_

## **How Each Dependency Helps**

To put that principle into practice, the Devcon team has created **two Drip Lists**:

1. [**Open-source products, tools, and projects used to organize Devcon**](https://www.drips.network/app/projects/github/efdevcon/tools?exact%20)
   This list funds the operational stack privacy-first collaboration tools, live-streaming infrastructure, content pipelines, analytics, and the bridges that keep conversations flowing.

2. [**Main repository for Devcon-related apps**](https://www.drips.network/app/projects/github/efdevcon/monorepo?exact)
   This list supports the EF’s own Devcon apps and services \- the code that’s shipped to deliver an excellent attendee experience.

A quick look at the key dependencies:

- **Wagmi** \- reactive primitives and wallet connectors for building Ethereum apps in TypeScript/React, covering accounts, networks, signing, and contract calls.
- **Viem** \- a type-safe TypeScript interface to Ethereum’s JSON-RPC with first-class smart-contract APIs and ABI utilities.
- **ethers.js** \- a complete, compact Ethereum library and wallet implementation for JS/TS, including providers, signers, and contract utilities.
- **Motion** \- a modern animation library for React/JavaScript/Vue that delivers fast, declarative UI motion with a hybrid engine.
- **CodiMD** \- real-time collaborative Markdown notes you can self-host for shared docs and live notes.
- **CryptPad** \- an end-to-end encrypted, open-source office suite for privacy-first collaboration.
- **StreamETH** \- open-source event and live-streaming for running and distributing conference content.
- **Remotion** \- create videos programmatically with React for templated and automated production.
- **FFmpeg** \- the core multimedia toolkit to record, convert, filter, and stream audio/video across formats.
- **t2bot.io** \- Matrix bots and bridges (e.g., Discord/Telegram) to keep conversations connected across platforms.
- **Matomo** \- a self-hosted, privacy-focused analytics platform and open-source alternative to Google Analytics.

Together, they make up part of the technical stack supporting Devcon’s infrastructure, communications, and analytics.

Funding these tools strengthens the commons and recognizes the open source builders who keep things running.

## **Drips & Devcon: A shared Open Source Ethos**

At Drips, our mission is simple: **we’re committed to helping organizations sustain Ethereum** by funding the software they rely on continuously, transparently, and in a way that’s sustainable.

“The Ethereum Foundation and Devcon have always led the way in exploring new ways to fund open-source software. By using Drips, their support cascades through the network of projects that make their work possible”
— _Eleftherios Diakomichalis, Founder, Drips_

With Drips teams can stream funds \- one-off or continuous \- to projects they care about, and as those projects map their dependencies, support drips downstream to the ecosystem projects that need it most. It’s predictable for maintainers, auditable for organizations, and aligned with Ethereum’s open-source ethos.

## **See you in Buenos Aires\!**

The next [**Devconnect**](https://devconnect.org/) is in **Buenos Aires this November**, and it will be the first-ever Ethereum World’s Fair. We can’t wait to see what the Devconnect team has in store for us\!

We’ll be there, presenting at the Ethereum World’s Fair in La Rural, to connect with maintainers, organizers, and teams interested in making dependency funding a default. If you’re there and want to talk about sustainably funding the tools your team relies on then [get in touch](https://drips-network.notion.site/1e4c52c9599781b5a0aeca3e8eb1b3e4).
